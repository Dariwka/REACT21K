## Hey there 🙋‍♀️

### My name is Iolanta Ubozhenko, and I am a full-time student of an awesome Full-Stack Web Developer program at Business College Helsinki.

I am passionate about design, and so far able to manage quite many Adobe programs such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, Illustrator. And I even find some time to learn After Effects.

But my main interest is programming and studying. I am good at HTML, CSS(Sass is waiting for me 😁). Javascript has been chosen as my main language I would like to focus on. Despite it, I am studying PHP, MySQL, UI/UX design.
