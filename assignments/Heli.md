### Hi there ğŸ˜˜

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP, Databases and React at Helsinki Business College
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming only 2 yers ago though I had some lessons of HTML and C over 20 years ago!
- ğŸ‘€ I am interested in learning games, like vocabulary games for beginners learning languages. I have one scratch in my Java Script repo named dragNdrop, made to learn dran and drop feature.
